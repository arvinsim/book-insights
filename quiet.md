# The North and South of Temperament
+ Introversion
+ Extroversion

We are told that it is great to be bold, to be happy and sociable.

We live with a value system called the Extrovert Ideal, the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight.

Introversion is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.

Many people pretend to be extroverts when they really are closet introverts.
